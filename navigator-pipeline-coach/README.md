- 🖥️ **CLI interface and job coordination**
- 🔗 **Integration between all agents**
- 📋 **Main entry point for SpiceflowNavigator**

### **Your Team's Mission**
Transform podcast content into strategic insights through a **proven, repeatable pipeline** that connects RSS feeds → transcription → analysis → actionable results.

## 📋 **Quick Setup**

```bash
# Clone the Pipeline repository  
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pa5tabear/SpiceflowNavigator-Pipeline.git
cd SpiceflowNavigator-Pipeline

# Install and verify
make install
make test

# Start developing
make dev
```

## 📚 **Essential Coach Files**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|

| `STARTER_CODE/` | Example implementations and patterns |
| `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` | Technical workflows and best practices |

## 🗺️ **10-Feature Roadmap Preview**

Your team will build these **high-impact features** (see `FEATURE_ROADMAP.md` for details):

1. **Smart CLI** - Intelligent command-line interface
2. **Workflow Engine** - Automated pipeline orchestration  
3. **Health Dashboard** - System monitoring and diagnostics
4. **Batch Processing** - Parallel job execution
5. **Configuration Management** - Dynamic settings and profiles
6. **Error Recovery** - Robust failure handling
7. **Progress Tracking** - Real-time job status
8. **Integration Hub** - Agent coordination layer
9. **Performance Metrics** - Analytics and optimization
10. **Deployment Tools** - Production deployment automation

## 🎯 **Sprint Planning System**

You'll use our **battle-tested** sprint methodology:

### **The Process**
1. **Review** current state using `MASTER_PROMPT.md`
2. **Plan** focused 3-task sprints using `SPRINT_TEMPLATE.md`  
3. **Execute** with your AI engineering team
4. **Review** and iterate for continuous improvement

### **Success Pattern**
```
Think → Plan → Code → Test → Review → Ship
```

Each sprint is **60 minutes** with **≤120 LOC** and **≥85% test coverage**.
