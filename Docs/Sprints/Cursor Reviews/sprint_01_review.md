# Sprint 01 Review

## Progress & Status
Sprint 01 goal was to "Fix failing CI pipeline and establish foundation CLI with basic workflow orchestration capabilities." **Partial Success**: Codex delivered enhanced CLI and workflow engine via PR #1, but CI pipeline remains red due to empty common-utils submodule. Core development work completed successfully, but integration blocker persists.

## Green Badges & Metrics
- **CI Status**: ðŸ”´ Still failing (3/3 Python versions)
- **PR Activity**: 1 merged PR (#1) with significant enhancements
- **LOC Delta**: +200 LOC estimated (enhanced CLI + workflow engine)
- **Test Coverage**: Unable to measure due to CI failures
- **Files Modified**: ~4-6 files (within budget)

## Demo-able Capability
Users can now access enhanced CLI with rich validation, progress indicators, and help system. New workflow engine supports parallel/sequential task execution with agent simulation. However, **not production-ready** due to CI failures preventing proper testing and validation.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
- **Critical Blocker**: Empty common-utils submodule breaking all CI runs
- **Cost**: 90 minutes development time spent, but value unrealized due to CI issues
- **Risk**: Development velocity blocked until CI fixed
- **Technical Debt**: Submodule dependency architecture needs resolution

## Failing CI Steps
- **Job**: test (Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- **Step**: Install dependencies
- **Error**: `pip install -e ./common-utils/` fails with "neither 'setup.py' nor 'pyproject.toml' found"
- **Root Cause**: Empty common-utils directory (0 files)

## TODOs Merged
Unable to scan for new TODO tags due to CI failures preventing proper code analysis pipeline execution.

## Decisions Needed
â€¢ **Submodule Strategy**: Initialize common-utils with proper Python package structure or remove dependency?
â€¢ **CI Workflow**: Add conditional installation logic for optional dependencies?
â€¢ **Development Process**: How to handle submodule dependencies in multi-repo architecture?
