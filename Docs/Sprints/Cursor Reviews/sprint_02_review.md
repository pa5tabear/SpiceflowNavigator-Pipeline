# Sprint 02 Review

## Progress & Status
Sprint 02 goal was to "Fix CI pipeline by resolving common-utils submodule dependency and establish green build status." **No Progress**: Sprint was planned but never executed by Codex. No commits, PRs, or code changes occurred during sprint window. CI pipeline remains in identical failed state since Sprint 01.

## Green Badges & Metrics
- **CI Status**: ðŸ”´ Still failing (unchanged from Sprint 01)
- **PR Activity**: 0 PRs opened or merged
- **LOC Delta**: 0 net changes (no development activity)
- **Test Coverage**: Still unmeasurable due to persistent CI failures
- **Sprint Execution**: 0% completion rate

## Demo-able Capability
No new user-facing capabilities delivered. Users still cannot reliably test or validate system functionality due to broken CI pipeline. Development workflow remains blocked at same point as Sprint 01 conclusion.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
- **Critical**: Sprint execution failure - Codex did not pick up Sprint 02 work
- **Cost**: 45 minutes allocated time unused, but opportunity cost of delayed CI fixes mounting
- **Risk**: Development velocity completely stalled, team confidence in sprint process declining
- **Escalation**: Need process review for sprint handoff between Cursor and Codex

## Failing CI Steps
- **Job**: test (Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11) - identical to Sprint 01
- **Step**: Install dependencies 
- **Error**: `pip install -e ./common-utils/` fails with "neither 'setup.py' nor 'pyproject.toml' found"
- **Root Cause**: Unchanged - empty common-utils directory blocking all builds

## TODOs Merged
No new code merged, therefore no new TODO tags introduced during Sprint 02 window.

## Decisions Needed
â€¢ **Sprint Execution**: Why was Sprint 02 plan not picked up by Codex? Process gap analysis required
â€¢ **CI Priority**: Should Cursor escalate CI fix to higher priority or different execution strategy?
â€¢ **Workflow**: Need clearer handoff protocol between sprint planning and execution phases
