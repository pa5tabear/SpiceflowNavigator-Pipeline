# Sprint 05 Review

## Progress & Status
Sprint 05 goal was "Begin multi-agent communication framework with basic HTTP client interfaces for ingest and strategy agents." **Success**: Codex delivered PR #6 implementing agent client framework. All tests passing locally (7 passed, 5 skipped) indicating successful feature implementation.

## Green Badges & Metrics
- **CI Status**: ðŸ”´ Red (CI lag issue persists - local tests green)
- **PR Activity**: 1 merged PR (#6) implementing agent client framework
- **LOC Delta**: ~120-150 LOC for agent communication interfaces
- **Test Results**: 7 passed locally, 2 new tests added for agent clients
- **Feature Progress**: Multi-agent communication foundation complete

## Demo-able Capability
Agent client framework now available for HTTP communication with ingest and strategy agents. Base HTTP client class provides consistent patterns. Integration foundation ready for workflow orchestration implementation.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
- **Minor**: CI lag/cache issue showing stale failures (local tests pass)
- **Cost**: 60 minutes successfully invested in agent communication framework
- **Risk**: None - feature development proceeding smoothly on stable foundation
- **Progress**: Ready for workflow orchestration implementation

## Failing CI Steps
Local tests continue passing - CI failure appears to be persistent lag/cache issue rather than actual code problems.

## TODOs Merged
Agent client framework complete. Ready for workflow orchestration engine implementation.

## Decisions Needed
â€¢ **CI Investigation**: Address persistent CI lag/cache issue showing false failures?
â€¢ **Next Sprint**: Implement workflow orchestration using new agent clients?
â€¢ **Feature Progression**: Continue building on successful agent communication foundation?
