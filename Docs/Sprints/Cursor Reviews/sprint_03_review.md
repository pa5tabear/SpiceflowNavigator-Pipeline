# Sprint 03 Review

## Progress & Status
Sprint 03 goal was "Emergency CI fix: resolve common-utils dependency blocking all builds with immediate workaround solution." **Partial Success**: Codex successfully resolved common-utils dependency issue via PR #4, but new test failure emerged in CLI multiprocessing code blocking CI green status.

## Green Badges & Metrics
- **CI Status**: ðŸ”´ Failing due to new test failure (not original common-utils issue)
- **PR Activity**: 1 merged PR (#4) successfully implementing emergency workaround
- **LOC Delta**: ~15-20 LOC removing common-utils dependency installation
- **Sprint Execution**: Primary objective achieved but unmasked secondary issue
- **Progress**: Common-utils blocker resolved, new blocker identified

## Demo-able Capability
Emergency workaround successful - common-utils dependency removed. However, CLI multiprocessing test (`test_cli_multi_runs`) fails with AttributeError preventing CI green status. Local development partially unblocked but CI still red.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
- **New Blocker**: CLI multiprocessing test failure - `Can't get local object '_run_multi.<locals>.transcribe'`
- **Cost**: 30 minutes spent on successful dependency fix
- **Risk**: Sprint approach successful but revealed hidden test issues in existing code
- **Technical Progress**: Moved from infrastructure blocker to application logic blocker

## Failing CI Steps
- **Job**: test (Python versions)
- **Step**: Run tests (`make test`)
- **Error**: `test_cli_multi_runs` fails with AttributeError in multiprocessing pickle serialization
- **Root Cause**: Local function not serializable for multiprocessing in CLI code

## TODOs Merged
Common-utils emergency workaround completed. New focus needed on CLI multiprocessing implementation fix.

## Decisions Needed
â€¢ **Next Sprint**: Fix CLI multiprocessing test failure to achieve green CI status?
â€¢ **Test Strategy**: Should failing test be fixed or removed if non-critical feature?
â€¢ **Sprint Success**: Count Sprint 03 as success (solved target issue) despite revealing new issue?
