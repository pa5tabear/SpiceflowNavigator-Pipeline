# Sprint 03 Review

## Progress & Status
Sprint 03 objective was an emergency CI workaround. The workflow was updated to stop installing the missing `common-utils` package, allowing all jobs to run. Local tests pass and CI is green again.

## Green Badges & Metrics
- **CI Status**: ðŸŸ¢ Passing across Python 3.9â€“3.11
- **PR Activity**: 1 PR merged removing the dependency step
- **LOC Delta**: under 20 LOC
- **Sprint Execution**: Completed on schedule

## Demo-able Capability
Builds succeed and `make test` runs without needing the optional utils package.

## Blockers / Costs / Risks
- **Risk**: Temporary workaround might hide deeper integration needs
- **Cost**: Minimal development time spent

## Decisions Needed
- When to reintroduce `common-utils` or replace with alternative utilities
