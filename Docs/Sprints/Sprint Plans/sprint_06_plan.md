# Sprint 06 Plan

## 1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)
Implement basic task scheduler with cron-like capabilities for agent health checks and maintenance tasks.

## 2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria

• **Simple Task Scheduler**: Create basic cron-like scheduling system for recurring agent coordination tasks
• **Task Registry**: Implement registration system for health checks, cleanup, and maintenance operations
• **Execution Loop**: Build simple event loop executor with task status tracking and logging

## 3 · Time-box & LOC Budget
60 min · ≤120 net LOC across ≤3 files

## 4 · Workflow

1. **Think**: Design simple task scheduling system following Layer 1 principles from progressive architecture
2. **Plan**: Define basic scheduler interface and task registration patterns for agent coordination
3. **Code**: Implement scheduler loop, task registry, and basic health check tasks for agents
4. **Test**: Create tests validating task scheduling, execution, and status tracking functionality

## 5 · Self-Review Rubric

- [ ] All local tests continue passing (maintain Sprint 05 progress)
- [ ] Task scheduler executes registered tasks on defined intervals
- [ ] Health check tasks successfully monitor agent status
- [ ] Simple task registry allows easy addition of new maintenance tasks
- [ ] Execution loop handles task failures gracefully without crashing
- [ ] Foundation ready for Layer 2 (inter-agent communication patterns)

## 6 · Proposed Next Sprint
Add Layer 2 inter-agent communication patterns and workflow triggers using task scheduler foundation.
