# Sprint 06 Plan

## 1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)
Implement workflow orchestration engine using agent clients for end-to-end pipeline execution and coordination.

## 2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria

• **Workflow Orchestrator**: Create orchestration engine coordinating ingest and strategy agents via HTTP clients
• **Pipeline Execution**: Implement end-to-end workflow from RSS discovery through analysis to results
• **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling and retry logic for agent communication failures

## 3 · Time-box & LOC Budget
75 min · ≤180 net LOC across ≤5 files

## 4 · Workflow

1. **Think**: Design workflow orchestration patterns using existing agent client framework
2. **Plan**: Define pipeline stages and error handling strategy for multi-agent coordination  
3. **Code**: Implement orchestrator class with sequential and parallel execution capabilities
4. **Test**: Create end-to-end tests validating complete pipeline execution workflows

## 5 · Self-Review Rubric

- [ ] All local tests continue passing (maintain Sprint 05 progress)
- [ ] Workflow orchestrator coordinates multiple agents successfully  
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline executes from RSS feeds to analysis results
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages agent communication failures
- [ ] Integration tests validate complete workflow scenarios
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and architectural consistency

## 6 · Proposed Next Sprint
Add CLI enhancements for workflow control and monitoring with progress indicators.
