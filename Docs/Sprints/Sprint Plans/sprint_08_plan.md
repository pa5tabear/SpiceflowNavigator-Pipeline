# Sprint 08 Plan

## 1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)
Begin Layer 2 inter-agent communication with event-driven task triggers and simple workflow definitions.

## 2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria

• **Event-Driven Triggers**: Implement event system allowing tasks to trigger based on agent status changes
• **Simple Workflow Definitions**: Create YAML-based workflow patterns for agent coordination sequences
• **Agent Message Routing**: Build message routing system for coordinated agent communication patterns

## 3 · Time-box & LOC Budget
75 min · ≤150 net LOC across ≤4 files

## 4 · Workflow

1. **Think**: Design Layer 2 event-driven communication patterns using robust Layer 1 scheduler foundation
2. **Plan**: Define workflow schema and message routing architecture for agent coordination
3. **Code**: Implement event triggers, YAML workflow parser, and agent message routing system
4. **Test**: Create tests validating event-driven workflows and inter-agent coordination patterns

## 5 · Self-Review Rubric

- [ ] All local tests continue passing (maintain Sprint 07 progress)
- [ ] Event system triggers tasks based on agent status changes
- [ ] YAML workflow definitions load and execute coordination sequences
- [ ] Message routing successfully coordinates agent communication
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end workflow execution
- [ ] Layer 2 foundation ready for enhancement in next sprint

## 6 · Proposed Next Sprint
Enhance Layer 2 with workflow condition handling and event queue management for complex coordination.
