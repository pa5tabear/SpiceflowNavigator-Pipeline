# Sprint 08 Plan

## 1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)
Create demo-able workflow orchestration CLI command showing Layer 2 inter-agent communication in action.

## 2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria

• **Demo Workflow Command**: `spiceflow run-workflow demo.yml` executes multi-agent coordination sequence with visible output
• **Sample Workflow Definition**: YAML file demonstrating Pipeline→Ingest→Strategy→UI agent coordination pattern
• **Event System Foundation**: Basic event-driven triggers enabling workflow step progression with status reporting

## 3 · Time-box & LOC Budget
75 min · ≤150 net LOC across ≤4 files

## 4 · Workflow

1. **Think**: Design Layer 2 event-driven communication patterns using robust Layer 1 scheduler foundation
2. **Plan**: Define workflow schema and message routing architecture for agent coordination
3. **Code**: Implement event triggers, YAML workflow parser, and agent message routing system
4. **Test**: Create tests validating event-driven workflows and inter-agent coordination patterns

## 5 · Self-Review Rubric

- [ ] All local tests continue passing (maintain Sprint 07 progress)
- [ ] `spiceflow run-workflow demo.yml` command executes successfully
- [ ] Demo workflow shows visible agent coordination with status updates
- [ ] YAML workflow parser loads and validates workflow definitions
- [ ] Event system triggers next workflow steps based on completion status
- [ ] User can see tangible multi-agent orchestration in terminal output

## 6 · Proposed Next Sprint
Enhance Layer 2 with workflow condition handling and event queue management for complex coordination.
