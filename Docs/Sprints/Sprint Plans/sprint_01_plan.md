# Sprint 01 Plan

## 1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)
Fix failing CI pipeline and establish foundation CLI with basic workflow orchestration capabilities.

## 2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria

• **Fix CI Pipeline**: All GitHub Actions jobs pass green, pytest runs successfully
• **Enhanced CLI Interface**: Implement rich CLI with validation, progress indicators, and help system  
• **Basic Workflow Engine**: Create async task orchestration with parallel/sequential execution support

## 3 · Time-box & LOC Budget
90 min · ≤200 net LOC across ≤6 files

## 4 · Workflow

1. **Think**: Analyze current CI failures and identify root causes
2. **Plan**: Design CLI enhancement strategy and workflow engine architecture  
3. **Code**: Implement fixes and new features following existing patterns
4. **Test**: Ensure all pytest cases pass and new functionality is covered

## 5 · Self-Review Rubric

- [ ] All CI jobs pass (green badges)
- [ ] CLI commands execute without errors
- [ ] Workflow engine handles both parallel and sequential tasks
- [ ] Code follows existing style conventions
- [ ] New features have basic test coverage
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing API contracts

## 6 · Proposed Next Sprint
Add multi-agent communication APIs and health monitoring dashboard.
