# Sprint 05 Plan

## 1 · Sprint Goal (≤25 words)
Begin multi-agent communication framework with basic HTTP client interfaces for ingest and strategy agents.

## 2 · Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria

• **Agent Client Framework**: Create base HTTP client class for agent communication patterns
• **Ingest Agent Interface**: Implement client for RSS discovery and transcription coordination  
• **Strategy Agent Interface**: Implement client for content analysis and scoring requests

## 3 · Time-box & LOC Budget
60 min · ≤150 net LOC across ≤4 files

## 4 · Workflow

1. **Think**: Design agent communication architecture and client interface patterns
2. **Plan**: Define HTTP API contracts and client class structure for agent coordination
3. **Code**: Implement base client framework and specific agent interfaces
4. **Test**: Create integration tests and verify agent communication patterns work

## 5 · Self-Review Rubric

- [ ] All CI jobs remain green (no regression from Sprint 04)
- [ ] Agent client interfaces follow consistent patterns
- [ ] HTTP communication properly handles errors and timeouts
- [ ] Integration tests validate agent coordination workflows
- [ ] Code follows existing style and architecture patterns
- [ ] Ready for workflow orchestration in future sprints

## 6 · Proposed Next Sprint
Implement workflow orchestration engine using agent clients for end-to-end pipeline execution.
